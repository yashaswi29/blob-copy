Source Blob Verification:

The script must verify that the source blob exists in the Azure Blob Storage before attempting to copy.
Dynamic Directory Traversal:

The script must dynamically traverse the blob container to find the specified target folder (e.g., procedure, hin-pqwrk-23h) without assuming a fixed directory structure.
The script should identify the actual location of these folders if they exist in the blob storage.
Destination Path Construction:

The destination path should not create new directories; instead, it should find the existing folders corresponding to the target names.
If a target folder (like procedure) is found alongside fre-mczbv-78d, the script should copy the file to the existing structure without creating new folders.
If a target folder (like hin-pqwrk-23h) is present alongside fre-mczbv-78d, the script should search within that folder for the appropriate path structure (like content/assets/images/africa/icon/procedure/) to paste the file.
Logging and Output:

The script should log the source blob being copied, the destination path, and any relevant success or error messages regarding the copy operation.
The output should clearly indicate whether the operation was successful or if the specified target folder was not found.
No Hard-Coding of Paths:

The script should avoid hard-coding paths and instead rely on the input provided through source.txt and the existing structure in the Azure Blob Storage.
Flexibility:

The logic should accommodate variations in folder names and paths without requiring specific folder structures to be predefined.
